# Privacy Filters

Block popular online trackers, for use in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

## What is blocked?

This list only blocks trackers I find NOT blocked in:

* EasyPrivacy
* MVPS HOSTS
* hpHostsâ€™ Ad and tracking servers

This list should be used in conjunction with other privacy filters.

## Issues

Please report any issues and site breakage with the filters at https://github.com/metaphoricgiraffe/tracking-filters/issues
